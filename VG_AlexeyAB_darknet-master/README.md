**You only look once (YOLO)** is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It is implemented based on the Darknet, an Open Source Neural Networks in C. In this project I improved the YOLO by adding several convenient functions for detecting objects for researches and the development community.

The added functions are implemented based on **AlexeyAB**  version of **Darknet**. As it is updated frequently, hereby I publish a stable version of AlexeyAB Darknet with those convenient functions. This repo will also be updated regularly.

Figure. The process of batch detecting images in a folder using Yolo based on the Darknet.


The **detector** function in AlexeyAB Darknet only supports a single image at a time. Therefore I added the batch function into this forked repo, which support detecting images in a folder in one time. Hope you like it. Please also refer to the post for detail:

[https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/723](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/723)

### Command
>./darknet detector batch cfg/coco.data cfg/yolov3.cfg weights/yolov3.weights batch exp/in_images/ exp/out_images/ > exp/results/results.txt

Parameter explain:
1. The input images are: **in_images/**
2. The output images are: **out_images/**
3. The detection classes with percentage is saved in: **exp/results/results.txt**

### Usage
1. Clone this project.
2. Download pre-trained weights file into folder **./weights/**. Such as: 

    [https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-openimages.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-openimages.weights)

3. Build the project
	3.1 For linux: Make the project with command in darknet/ folder: 
	>make
	
	3.2 For windows, please modify one line in top in the detector.c, using the header file for Windows.
	
	//#include <dirent.h> //for linux, ubuntu, macos
	
	#include "dirent_win.h" //for windows
	
	Then it can be successfully built on Visual Studio.
	
5. Use the command described above to perform batch detecting images.
